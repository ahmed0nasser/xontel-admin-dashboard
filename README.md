## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- pnpm (or npm/yarn)
- A Firebase project with Firestore and Authentication enabled.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd admin-dashboard
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Firebase Configuration**:
    - Create a `.env.local` file in the project root.
    - Add your Firebase project configuration details:
      ```
      VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
      VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN"
      VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
      VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET"
      VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
      VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_APP_ID"
      ```
    - Ensure you have a user with `role: "hr"` in your Firebase Firestore `employees` collection for the admin panel to function correctly.
    - Optionally, run the seeding scripts to populate your Firestore with initial data (see "Seeding Data" section below).

### Running the Application

To start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

### Building for Production

To build the application for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

The optimized production build will be generated in the `dist/` directory.

## Firebase Firestore DB Schema

## Seeding Data (Optional)

The project includes scripts to seed your Firebase Firestore with initial employee, conversation, and feedback data.

1.  **Ensure Firebase is configured** as described in the "Installation" section.
2.  **Run the seeding scripts**:
    ```bash
    pnpm seed-feedback
    pnpm seed-employees
    ```
    _Note: You might need to install `tsx` globally or locally if you haven't already (`pnpm add -D tsx`)._
